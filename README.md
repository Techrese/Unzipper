# Archive-Extraction-Tool

Ever came across a certain folder full of compressed archives and don't want to manually extract them. just a waste of time, use this tool to extract multiple zip archives in  every subfolder of a certain parent folder.

I have created this simple tool because i needed a tool that extarcted multiple zip file or other archives.
